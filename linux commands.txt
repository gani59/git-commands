*********permissions concept******
Here we have 
*file mode = drwxr-xr-x
*owner = ubuntu
*group = ubuntu
*filesize = 4096
*lastmodified = jul 19 2022
*file/diectory name =ram/sam
(note above mentiond naming are will be straight line u can see in linux by entering command ls -l)
e.g:-
drwxr-xr-x   ubuntu   ubuntu      4096          jul 19 2022       ram/sam
(file mode)  (root)   (root)  (file size)   (lastmodified date)  (file/direc)

CHANGE PERMISSIONS=====>
And we have the sybolic mode for these
1.drwxr-xr-x (it is directory)
2.-rwxr-xr-x (it is file)

here we have symbolic modes those are *user *group *other
-rwx     r-x     r-x
(user)  (group) (other)

1. 0   ---  no-permission
2. 1   --x  excute
3. 2   -w-  write
4. 3   -wx  write and excute
5. 4   r--  read 
6. 5   r-x  read and excute
7. 6   rw-  read and write
8. 7   rwx read write and excute



If we want to change the permissions for the file above things should be learnt...

sudo chmod 777 file name (file permision given all)

sudo chmod 737 file name ( i want write and excute permission to gruop)


CHANGE OWNER-USER ======>

-rw-rw-rw- 1 ubuntu      ubuntu         218 Feb  1 06:29 don
            (OWNER-USE) (OWNER-GROUP)
sudo chown root file.name
